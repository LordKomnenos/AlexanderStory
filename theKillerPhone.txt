It was cold. It was windy. I was walking alone along on a long dirt road through 
which went through the mountains. I needed to make a phone call but the cold froze my phone. I saw the battery drop to 0% and BANG! It stopped working.
I felt my spine shiver as I knew no hope existed. The old man had warned me that this phone was cursed. With it's gps, it led me into the mountains to have its battery die and have me die along with it. Hence, the nickname the old man gave it, The Killer Phone.
