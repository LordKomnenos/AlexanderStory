It was cold. It was windy. I was walking alone along on a long dirt road through 
which went through the mountains. I needed to make a phone call but the cold froze my phone. I saw the battery drop to 0% and BANG! It stopped working.
I felt my spine shiver as I knew no hope existed. The old man had warned me that this phone was cursed. With it's gps, it led me into the mountains to have its battery die and have me die along with it. Hence, the nickname the old man gave it, The Killer Phone.
I didn't know what to do so I kept walking, hoping that I would find another person or another place. As it got darker and darker, I started getting even more nervous. Then, I heard some leaves crunching. I turned around, looking for another person 
or another animal but couldn't see anything. Then, when I turned back around, there was a pack of wolves staring me in the face.
